# Advent of Code 2023

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) for 2023. The plan this year is to do them in Ruby, and focus on practicing TDD, object-oriented design, and refactoring.

## Usage

Solve all puzzles:

    $ just run

Solve one puzzle:

    $ ruby advent.rb 14

Run all tests:

    $ just test

Rerun tests on file change:

    $ just watch
